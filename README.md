## Targeting E3 Ubiquitin Ligases for Cancer Treatment

### Abstract: 
Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 80-85% of cases. Among NSCLC subtypes, adenocarcinoma is frequently driven by mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Although significant advancements in EGFR-targeted therapies have improved patient survival, resistance to treatment often emerges, necessitating the development of new therapeutic strategies for EGFR-mutant lung cancer. One promising approach involves targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), a critical pathway for proteolytic degradation of proteins. The E3 ubiquitin ligase enzymes play a pivotal role in recognizing and marking specific proteins for degradation. By focusing on E3 ligases essential to the survival and proliferation of EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells, novel therapeutic interventions may be uncovered. To identify key E3 ligases, I utilized the DepMap database to analyze cancer dependencies, pinpointing those required for cell growth in EGFR-mutant lung cancer lines. One of the candidates was HUWE1 which targets substrats such as p53 and EGFR. Our analysis determined that HUWE1 kd does not inhibit tumor growth in non-cancerous cells. This research is ongoing and more discoveries are happening to draw further conclusions. This approach provides a foundation for targeting E3 ligases that are crucial for tumor progression, potentially offering new avenues for treatment.


### Summary: 
This project focuses on determining the dependence of different tumor types to individual E3 Ligases.
E3 ligases are critical components of the Ubiquitin Proteosome system, and are required for mediating
the attachment of Ubiquitin to substrates. Unlike targeting downstream components of the UPS, pinpointing
specific E3 enzymes can provide a more targeted and tumor-specific approach for therapeutic intervention.
Through a combination of computational and functional genomics methodologies, this project aims to identify
tumor-specific dependencies on distinct E3 ligases. The ultimate goal is to uncover novel therapeutic targets for
cancer treatment. This innovative approach holds promise for advancing personalized cancer therapy by
utilizing the intricacies of the UPS and its potential as a tailored therapeutic avenue.
