# Targeting_E3_Ubiquitin_Ligases_for_Cancer_Treatment

Summary: This project focuses on determining the dependence of different tumor types to individual E3 Ligases.
E3 ligases are critical components of the Ubiquitin Proteosome system, and are required for mediating
the attachment of Ubiquitin to substrates. Unlike targeting downstream components of the UPS, pinpointing
specific E3 enzymes can provide a more targeted and tumor-specific approach for therapeutic intervention.
Through a combination of computational and functional genomics methodologies, this project aims to identify
tumor-specific dependencies on distinct E3 ligases. The ultimate goal is to uncover novel therapeutic targets for
cancer treatment. This innovative approach holds promise for advancing personalized cancer therapy by
utilizing the intricacies of the UPS and its potential as a tailored therapeutic avenue.
